# BudgetBytesCli

This is a CLI interface for [Budget Bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com), a recipe blog.  This CLI enables the user to select a category of recipes, select a recipe from within the category, and to launch the recipe's page in the default web browser.  It also allows the user to "combine categories", in other words to see a list of recipes which appear in two categories and to select a recipe from this list to display.

## Installation

Run the following command in the terminal to install from rubygems.org:

    $ gem install budget-bytes-cli

## Usage

Run the following command in the terminal, and follow the on-screen prompts:
    
    $budget-bytes-cli

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
